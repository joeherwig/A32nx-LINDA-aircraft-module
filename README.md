# A32nx LINDA aircraft module

## For FSUIPC based A32nx homecockpits
In case you want to assign functionality from the FlyByWireSim A32nx which is usually only available via the virtual cockpit to your home cockpit buttons, switches and encoders i provide here a aircraft module making functionality of L:Vars available for assignments onto your hardware devices.
