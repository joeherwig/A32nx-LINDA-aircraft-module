1.0.0
° Renamed nearly all the functions based on the FBW naming conventions. See https://github.com/joeherwig/A32nx-LINDA-aircraft-module/wiki/Contribute#naming-conventions
  As this causes breaking changes and might require re-assignments / renamings of your configuration i decided to give it a new major version.
  The community feedback was excellent
° Merged plenty PRs
+ Added example for Dimmer assignments (display and flood / integ. light brightness.) See Wiki.
